# Tutorials for FSO interactive development

These tutorials cover scripting for Freespace Open(FSO), in particular the use of the [Plasma Core](https://github.com/FSO-Scripters/fso-scripts/blob/master/plasma_core) library and interactive development workflows enabled by it. 

For new or potential scripters my aims are to demystify the process of breaking ideas down into code the engine can use, and give you tools to minimize some of the more frustrating aspects of development.

For experienced scripters I'll show off the tools I've built to enable a workflow that I find incredibly enjoyable and powerful.

The introduction document gives context on what I'm doing and the tools I'm using, but in general I am assuming you are familiar with  familiar with lua or at least general programming, and a basic grasp of FSO modding, but will try not to assume much FSO-scripting specific knowledge and explain as I go. The FSO wiki [scripting introduction](https://wiki.hard-light.net/index.php/FS2_Open_Lua_Scripting) is a great resource for filling in any gaps I may leave, or simply getting another perspective on the modern state of scripting.

As I expand this I will include directories for each tutorial containing the mod demoing that tutorial.
